This is a small file to keep track of my Arch installation process, so I can recreate it again in
the future if I need to, or potentially write an install script.

Initial packages can be minimal, but I'll make a file with explicitly installed packages later

Initial installation (after pacstrap):
- Mostly just follow wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide and other pages
- Fstab, chroot
- time + time syncronization
- Generate locales, include en_US.UTF-8, en_AU.UTF-8, ja_JP.UTF-8, set locale variables
- set hostname, add "127.0.1.1 <hostname>" in /etc/hosts
- setup network with systemd-resolved and networkmanager (Disable LLMNR)
- Set root password
- Install bootloader (systemd-boot)

Now boot directly and set things up
- Add required packages
- IPv6 privacy extentions
- Make sure zsh in /etc/shells
- Create user account in wheel, with zsh
- Add wheel in sudoers  
- Disable root account
- Add SSH key
- Add shell config
- install nvidia drivers (dkms, lib32 utils, add to mkinitcpio modules)
- hyprland, other user config
