Config TODO:

- Reconfigure keyboard. Do this on Windows through a browser, completely reset firmware, update firmware, probably switch to mac layer, make command key to right, and set up media keys properly under a layer (F keys on top for now)
- consider upping mouse dpi to 1600, set windows setting to 4/11, hyprland sens to 0.5 (check if it works with force_no_accel)
- Hyprland binds. Keep it relatively simple for now maybe...
- App launcher
- Firefox
- spotify
- veskord
